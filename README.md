# Rack::Console

Find yourself missing a `rails console` analogue in your other Ruby web applications? This lightweight gem provides a Rack::Console class that will load your Rack application's code and environment into an IRB or Pry session. Either use `Rack::Console.new(options).start` directly, or run the provided `rack-console` executable.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "rack-console"
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or install it system-wide:

```bash
$ gem install rack-console
```

## Usage

Rack::Console ships with a `rack-console` executable that will load your application in an IRB shell (or
[Pry](http://pryrepl.org) if that's included in your Gemfile and you specify the `--pry` option). Assuming you have a `config.ru` file in the current directory, simply run:

```
$ bundle exec rack-console
Loading development environment (Rack::Console 2.0.0)
irb(main):001>
```

Rack::Console supports some of the same things that `rails console` provides, as well as some of the options used in `rackup`:

 * An `app` method that will return your underlying Rack application with [rack-test](https://github.com/brynary/rack-test) methods mixed in. You can perform fake requests to your app (e.g. `response = app.get('/')`)
 * A `reload!` method to discard new code or defined variables/constants
 * The `-c` option (or `--config`) to specify a non-standard `config.ru` file
 * The `-e` option (or `--environment`) to specify the Rack environment to load
 * The `-r` option (or `--require`) to require a file/library before Rack::Console loads
 * The `-I` option (or `--include`) to specify paths (colon-separated) to add to `$LOAD_PATH` before Rack::Console loads
 * The `-P` option (or `--[no-]pry`) to specify whether to use Pry instead of IRB (Pry must be installed in your project)

## Framework CLI Example

Because Rack::Console is just a class, it's easy to provide a `console` subcommand to a CLI for your own Rack framework. For example, here's how you could hypothetically implement a `console` subcommand for a generic Rack CLI using [Thor](https://github.com/rails/thor):

```ruby
require "rack/console"
require "thor"

module Rack
  class CLI < Thor
    desc "console [ENVIRONMENT]", "Start a Rack console"

    method_option :config,  aliases: "-c", type: "string", desc: "Specify a Rackup file (default: config.ru)"
    method_option :require, aliases: "-r", type: "string", desc: "Require a file/library before console boots"
    method_option :include, aliases: "-I", type: "string", desc: "Add colon-separated paths to $LOAD_PATH"

    def console
      # Set a custom intro message:
      #   ENV["RACK_CONSOLE_INTRO"] = "Loading Rack::Console..."
      #
      # Or, to prevent an intro message from being printed at all:
      #   ENV["IGNORE_RACK_CONSOLE_INTRO"] = "true"
      Rack::Console.new(options).start
    end
  end
end

Rack::CLI.start(ARGV)
```
